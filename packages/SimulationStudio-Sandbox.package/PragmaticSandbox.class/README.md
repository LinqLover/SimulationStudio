I choose a more pragmatic approach to sandboxing by using an allow-list of methods that are executed outside of the sandbox. This makes practical assumptions about not changing certain objects to improve the performance for certain queries significantly until the sandboxed code modifies these objects. In some cases, my pre-checks might be too weak, and side effects of the sandboxed code might not be visible to the sandboxed code itself.
